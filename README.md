# livecodingtv-bot-features

# Important!

This is not my original project, I'm just building features for it.

Please go [here](https://github.com/owenconti/livecodingtv-bot) to see the original project.

## Instalation

**NOTE! this installation may not work when you try it out, since the original project is still being development at this moment and things will change!**

- First of all you need to the original project from [here](https://github.com/owenconti/livecodingtv-bot) and install that.

- Drag the "modules" folder into the project folder.

- Copy the content of to_index.js

- place that into the projects index.js file under the lines where stuff gets required. ( comparison [here](http://i.imgur.com/HWfMeh4.png))
